✅ Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions to enforce code quality.

CI Workflow

The CI pipeline runs automatically on every pull request to main and performs:
• Code formatting check using Prettier
• JavaScript linting using ESLint

If any check fails, the pull request is blocked from merging.
